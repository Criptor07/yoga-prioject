# yoga-prioject

To run the server, after cloning the repository run the command in the main directory of the project.

-> npm install (download all the dependencies)

-> npm start (start the server)

To run the server on custom port , add a .env file in the main directory and add a PORT = <PORT_NO> in the file, otherwise by default the server will run on port 3000.

Ex: PORT = 1234
